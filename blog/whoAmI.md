# Who Am I

Hi my name is Matt Chapman I am a frontend developer currently working at Draftkings on the Casino web product. 
I work mainly in React and Typescript with experience using many different javascript libraries.
I've been working in the frontend / web space for about 5 years now. I currently work on the Casino web app 
for Draftkings and have been doing so for almost 3 years now. Before DK I was at a Boston based fitness wearable company,
Whoop, where I was responsible for handling their internationalization effort. Though I primarily work on the frontend in 
my free time I enjoy working on fullstack applications, like the blog you're reading! I hope to use this blog to detail some
of the things I work on in my free time as well as problems I solve at work.
